# SteerSafe: Driver Drowsiness Detection System

SteerSafe is a driver drowsiness detection system that leverages machine learning techniques to enhance road safety by monitoring and analyzing driver alertness in real-time.

## Features
- ‚ú® **Drowsiness Monitoring**: Assesses driver alertness during vehicle operation via analysing and computing the facial features of the driver, furthermore classifying it into classes, being a classification kind of problem statement.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Alert System**: Provides immediate warnings to drivers upon detecting signs of drowsiness.
- üíª **User-Friendly Interface**: Displays real-time feedback and system status through an intuitive graphs and accuracy measures.

## Tech Stack
SteerSafe utilizes the following technologies:

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - NumPy: For numerical computations and analysis of our data once the images are transformed to binary data for data manipulation.
  - Pygame: For handling audio alerts.
  - Pytorch: For building and deploying deep learning models such as the ResNet 152 or Version 1.5 used in our model to build upon a residual neural network for accurate image classification.
- **Machine Learning**:
  - **ResNet 152**: ResNet-152 is a 152-layer deep convolutional neural network that utilizes residual learning to address the vanishing gradient problem, allowing deeper networks to be trained effectively. It was introduced in the ResNet (Residual Networks) family by He et al. in 2015.
  - Key Features of ResNet-152
  -   **Residual Learning**: Uses shortcut (skip) connections to enable training of very deep networks without the degradation problem.
  -   **Bottleneck Blocks**: Each residual block consists of three layers (1x1, 3x3, and 1x1 convolutions) instead of two, making it computationally efficient.
  -   **Deeper but Efficient**: Despite having 152 layers, it has fewer parameters compared to a traditional deep network of the same depth due to bottleneck design.
  - **Custom Layers**: Additional attention-based layers, including **Channel Attention Mechanism**, to enhance feature representation.
  - **Data Augmentation**: Techniques such as flipping, rotation, and brightness adjustment to improve model generalization.
